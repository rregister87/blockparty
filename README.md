A simple float based SASS grid system.

After years of toying with SASS frameworks such as Susy and Bourbon Neat, I've finally begun the process of creating my own simplistic SASS based grid system. While Bourbon Neat 1.8 was excellent in many ways, it wasn't particulary intuitive in my opinion, and I only need a small portion of the functionality for day to day use. Version 2.0 was well intentione and simplified many things, but removed some of the core functionality I had come to rely on.

This is by no means a production ready project. Check back here for additional functionality and documentation in the future.
